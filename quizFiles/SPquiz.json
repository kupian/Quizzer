        "question": "How does C program compilation work?",
        "answer": "1. Preprocessor: Expands macros like #include and #define. 2. Compiler: Converts code to assembly, then to machine code (object file). 3. Linker: Combines object files, checks for missing functions (e.g. printf)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the linker's role?",
        "answer": "Combines object files into one executable. Ensures all functions are correctly linked to their machine code."
